# Installing sourcetracker
Once we `ssh` into Cirrus and are in our home directory (or wherever you want to install this), we clone SourceTracker from Dan Knight's GitHub repository.

```{}
# clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/danknights/sourcetracker.git

# Enter repo folder
cd sourcetracker
```

Now we just have to configure a few things, which will allow us to run SourceTracker from the command line, rather than in R. To do this, we need to have the path of our top-level SourceTracker repository folder script stored in the environment variable, `SOURCETRACKER_PATH`. I did this:

```{}
# Creating a system variable called SOURCETRACKER_PATH
# we'll add this to a .bash_profile file in our home directory.
echo "" >> ~/.bash_profile
echo "export SOURCETRACKER_PATH=/lustre/home/d411/alorax1/sourcetracker" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile

# To check if it's installed and accessible to QIIME
print_qiime_config.py
# if it worked it'll say
sourcetracker is installed ... ok
# you can also run:
R --slave --vanilla --args -h < $SOURCETRACKER_PATH/sourcetracker_for_qiime.r
# if you see SourceTracker's help text appear, then it worked.
```

# Filter OTUs present in <1% of samples from OTU table
We filter OTUs that are present in very few samples under the assumption that they are unlikely to yield useful source tracking information. "Few samples" = <1% of samples. To determine this for my dataset, I took 1% of the mean of my counts/sample, which gave me 1782 samples (not rounded).

```{}
# To filter OTU table:
filter_otus_from_otu_table.py -i otu_table.biom -o filtered_otu_table.biom -s 1
```
But I didn't do this in this case...

# Convert table from BIOM to txt format
SourceTracker can only work with `.txt` files. So I'm going to go into my directory where my otu `BIOM` table is stored, and convert it.
```{}
# Convert .biom to .txt format
biom convert -i otu_table_mc2_w_tax.biom -o otu_table_mc2_w_tax.txt --to-tsv
```

# Run SourceTracker
Running SourceTracker from my QIIME environment. Note: the mapping file must contain two additional columns: `Env` and `SourceSink` where you should write what environment the samples came from, and say whether a sample is a `source` or `sink`, respectively.

A `source` is usually multiple samples that are from an environment of interest, whereas a `sink` is typically a single sample.
```{}
R --slave --vanilla --args \
-i /lustre/home/d411/alorax1/data/2018/otu_open_ref/otu_table_mc2_w_tax.txt \
-m /lustre/home/d411/alorax1/data/2018/updated_2018_map_sourcetracker.txt \
-o /lustre/home/d411/alorax1/data/2018/sourcetracker_out < $SOURCETRACKER_PATH/sourcetracker_for_qiime.r
```

And we're done! You'll find a directory containing PDF files containing images, I got this image as an example:

> Note: SourceTracker2 is a major improvement however, as it can run jobs in parallel.
