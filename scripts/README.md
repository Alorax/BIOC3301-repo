# Scripts Setup Information
- The order in which each of the scripts were performed are indicated in numerical order, i.e. quality checking was performed first, then the basic QIIME pipeline workflow, and then the scripts for further data analyses within QIIME.
- The numerical ordering is applied not only to folder level, but also file-level.
- The output of each of these scripts can be found in the [figures](https://github.com/Alorax/ProjectY/tree/master/figures) folder.
